			<h1>What Is Climate Change?</h1>
			
			<!--row of 1 col-->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Climate change is one of the largest issues that society faces today. It refers to the shifts in temperatures and weather patterns over a long period of time. These shifts can be caused naturally by the sun changing activity. However, for hundreds of years, it is human activities that has been the leading cause of climate change. In the last 100 years, our use of fossil fuels has caused our planet to get increasingly warmer. This has effected the earth extremely negatively. </p>
				</div>
				
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>Carbon dioxide and methane are the main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. There are many example of how this is happening, for example deforestation, agricultural operations, using gasoline for driving cars, or using coal to heat up a building. All of these things are the main contributing factors to climate change.</p>

			<h2><u>Consequences of Climate Change:</u></h2>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Rising Temperatures</h4>
					<p>Due to the consistent rise in concentration of greenhouse gases, the global temperature continues to rise, with each decade being significantly warmer than the last starting back in the 1980's. Some of the consequences of this include wildfires starting and spreading more easily, more frequent heat-waves and it makes working outdoors more difficult due to heat related illnesses.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Extreme weather events</h4> 
					<p>With the temperature rising more, this leads to more moisture evaporating. This results in extreme rainfall and flooding causing destructive storms. The oceans are getting warmer, and hurricanes and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. These kind of storms lead to massive and sometimes fatal destruction, also causing major economic loss.</p>
				</div>
			</div>		

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Oceans warming and rising</h4>
					<p>Over the last 20 years, the ocean has been rapidly getting warmer. This causes the water to expand, increasing its volume. Melting ice glaciers also have a huge impact on sea levels rising. This directly threats many coastal and island communities.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Extinction of species</h4>
					<p>The survival of many different species both on land and in the ocean, is at risk due to climate change. Species are going extinct at the fastest rate we have ever seen in humanity. Within the next few decades, there are over a million species that are at risk of becoming extinct. Factors that contribute to this are forest fires and extreme weather.</p>
				</div>
			</div>		

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Health risks</h4>
					<p>Air pollution, increased hunger, disease, and poor nutrition are just some of the ways that climate change has harmed peoples health. Environmental factors are responsible for taking the lives of 13 million people yearly. Deaths increase due to these extreme weather events.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4>Poverty and displacement</h4>
					<p>People are increasingly being put in poverty due to climate change. Floods have destroyed homes and livelihoods. Extreme weather events have displaced around 23 million people in the last 10 years. </p>
