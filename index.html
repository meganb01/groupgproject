					<p class="climate-facts">Human activity has been the main cause of the majority of the increase in global temperatures since 1950. These main causes include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, the mass producing of meat and crops, and deforestation to make way for infrastructure. These kinds of activities cause the global temperature to rise by releasing greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the atmosphere.</p>

					<!--paragraph to display under image -->
					<p class="climate-facts">The greenhouse effect is what determines the average temperature of the earth. Greenhouse gases absorb radiation from the sun passing through the atmosphere, preventing the heat from leaving. We need this to happen for the earth to be a suitable temperature to sustain life. However, by adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere via human activities, this causes the suns energy to get trapped inside the atmosphere, heating the earth, causing global warming.</p>

					<p class="climate-facts">Arctic sea ice and glaciers are melting. This is one of the most well known facts about global warming. This melting ice causes sea levels to rise. The average sea level is expected to rise over one meter before the end of the century. The effects of this will massively impact people who live in low-lying areas, putting them at risk of immense flooding. </p>

					<img src="./images/forest.jpg" class="facts-img" alt="forest">
					<!--paragraph to display under image -->
					<p class="climate-facts">The deforestation of rainforests is a huge factor in carbon dioxide release. This is because trees and forests store carbon dioxide as they grow so when they are destroyed, they release large amounts of it in to the atmosphere, which contributes further to global warming.</p>

					<!--paragraph to display under image -->
					<p class="climate-facts">Half of the world's coral reefs have died over the last 30 years due to human activities and increasing temperatures. Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their algae due to increasingly warm temperatures in the water. Corals need this algae to survive, so the loss of this causes them to lose their vibrant colours and turn white. This has a huge impact on the sea life that inhabits these corals.</p>

					<p class="climate-facts">A large amount of species are at risk of going extinct due to climate change. The majority of plants are not able to change their location fast enough to keep up with the fast rates of climate change. The majority of mammals will also not be able to keep up with this. </p>

					<h4>Dont use desposable cups</h4>
